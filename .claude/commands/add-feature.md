I want to add a new feature: $ARGUMENTS

Before implementing, please:

1. Review /docs/ARCHITECTURE.md to understand the system architecture
2. Check if this feature affects the database schema (Prisma)
3. Identify which files need to be created or modified
4. Plan the implementation steps
5. Add tasks to /docs/TASK_LIST.md if needed

Then provide a plan for implementing this feature, including:
- Database schema changes (if any)
- New components needed
- API routes or server actions required
- UI/UX considerations
- Testing requirements

Ask for approval before starting implementation.
