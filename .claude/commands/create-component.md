Create a new component: $ARGUMENTS

The component should:

1. Use TypeScript with proper types
2. Follow the ShadCN/UI purple theme
3. Be responsive (mobile-first)
4. Include proper accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
5. Handle loading and error states
6. Be properly documented with JSDoc comments
7. Include a test file

Place the component in the appropriate directory (src/components/) and follow the project's naming conventions.

If the component needs data, create the necessary server actions or API routes.
